# A Gentle Introduction to Deep Learning 

## Materials for IMPRS summer school workshop

### interactive notebook
- try out a simple CNN on MNIST with CNN-MNIST-Keras.ipynb

### other resources:
- To see some more complex CNN models, have a look at these cool 3D interactive visualization at https://tensorspace.org And you can draw your own inputs as well ! 
- A lot of interactive visualizations collected [here](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/Interactive_Tools#readme)
 
- Highly recommended: Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning [here](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)
- Videos from 3Blue1Brown about Deep Neural Networks, available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=2)
